# ENTSO-E forecasts & data

Importing data which can be relevant for energy flexibility services via ENTSO-E's API into FlexMeasures.

We start with data about the upcoming day.

- Generation forecasts for the upcoming day
- Based on these, CO2 content for the upcoming day
- Day-ahead prices


## Usage

Importing tomorrow's prices:

    flexmeasures entsoe import-day-ahead-prices

Importing tomorrow's generation (incl. CO2 estimated content):

    flexmeasures entsoe import-day-ahead-generation

Use ``--help`` to learn more usage details.


## Installation

First of all, this is a FlexMeasures plugin. Consult the FlexMeasures documentation for setup.

1. Add the plugin to [the `FLEXMEASURES_PLUGINS` setting](https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#plugin-config). Either use `/path/to/flexmeasures-entsoe/flexmeasures_entsoe` or `flexmeasures_entsoe` if you installed this as a package locally (see below).

2. Add `ENTSOE_AUTH_TOKEN` to your FlexMeasures config (e.g. ~/.flexmeasures.cfg).
You can generate this token after you made an account at ENTSO-E, read more [here](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/Static%20content/web%20api/Guide.html#_authentication_and_authorisation). 

   Optionally, override other settings (defaults shown here):

       ENTSOE_COUNTRY_CODE = "NL"
       ENTSOE_COUNTRY_TIMEZONE = "Europe/Amsterdam"
       ENTSOE_DERIVED_DATA_SOURCE = "FlexMeasures ENTSO-E"

   The `ENTSOE_DERIVED_DATA_SOURCE` option is used to name the source of data that this plugin derives from ENTSO-E data, like a COâ‚‚ signal.
   Original ENTSO-E data is reported as being sourced by `"ENTSO-E"`.

3. To install this plugin locally as a package, try `pip install .`.


## Testing

ENTSO-E provides a test server (iop) for development. It's good practice not to overwhelm their production server.

Set ``ENTSOE_USE_TEST_SERVER=True`` to enable this.

In that case, this plugin will look for the auth token in the config setting ``ENTSOE_AUTH_TOKEN_TEST_SERVER``.

Note, however, that ENTSO-E usually does not seem to make the latest data available there. Asking for the next day can often get an empty response.


## Development

To keep our code quality high, we use pre-commit:

    pip install pre-commit black flake8 mypy
    pre-commit install

or:
    
    make install-for-dev

Try it:

    pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
